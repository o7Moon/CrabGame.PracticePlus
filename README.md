# FAQ
### How do i use savestates?
- Save states only work in practice mode
- Press q to save you current position
- Left click + Shift to return to your saved position
### Where are all the lobbies?
crab game detects mods and only lets you play in lobbies hosted by other players with mods. if you would like to play unmodded lobbies, move the `BepInEx` folder and `winhttp.dll` file out of your game folder (I have a folder called `Game Folder/mod_storage` that i move them to) to temporarily disable mods.
